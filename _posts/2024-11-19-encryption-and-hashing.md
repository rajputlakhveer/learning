# 🔒 Encryption and Hashing: Securing the Digital World 🌐  

In today's data-driven world, **security** isn't optional—it's essential! From safeguarding your passwords to ensuring online transactions are secure, **encryption** and **hashing** are the unsung heroes of digital security. Let’s dive into what they are, why we need them, and how they work, with examples of some major algorithms you should know! 🚀

## 🔑 What is Encryption?  

Encryption is like a digital lock 🔐—it transforms your readable data (*plaintext*) into a scrambled format (*ciphertext*) that only authorized people can unlock using a secret key.  

### **Why Do We Need Encryption?**  
1. **Confidentiality**: Keep sensitive data private (e.g., your credit card details).  
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensure data isn’t tampered with during transmission.  
3. **Authentication**: Verify the sender or receiver’s identity.  

---

### 🛠️ How Does Encryption Work?  

Encryption uses **keys** (random strings) to encode and decode data. It comes in two types:  
1. **Symmetric Encryption**: One key for both encryption and decryption.  
2. **Asymmetric Encryption**: A pair of keys—public key for encryption, private key for decryption.

### ⚙️ Popular Encryption Algorithms  

#### 1️⃣ **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**  
- **Type**: Symmetric  
- **Use Case**: Securing sensitive data like financial transactions.  
- **Example**:  
    ```ruby
    require 'openssl'

    cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new('AES-128-CBC')
    cipher.encrypt
    key = cipher.random_key
    iv = cipher.random_iv
    encrypted = cipher.update("Hello, Secure World!") + cipher.final
    puts "Encrypted Text: #{encrypted}"
    ```

#### 2️⃣ **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**  
- **Type**: Asymmetric  
- **Use Case**: Secure communication (e.g., emails).  
- **Example**:  
    - Public key encrypts: *“🔑 Send this secure message!”*  
    - Private key decrypts: *“🎉 Message received!”*  

#### 3️⃣ **Blowfish**  
- **Type**: Symmetric  
- **Use Case**: Securing passwords and file transfers.

## 🔍 What is Hashing?  

Hashing is like a digital fingerprint scanner 🖐️—it converts data into a fixed-length string, ensuring **data integrity** but making it irreversible.  

### **Why Do We Need Hashing?**  
1. **Data Integrity**: Verify that data hasn’t been altered.  
2. **Authentication**: Store and validate passwords securely.  
3. **Fast Lookup**: Quickly search in databases.

### 🛠️ How Does Hashing Work?  

Hashing uses **mathematical algorithms** to generate a unique hash value for the input. Even a tiny change in input results in a completely different hash!  

---

### ⚙️ Popular Hashing Algorithms  

#### 1️⃣ **MD5 (Message Digest 5)**  
- **Purpose**: Basic checksums.  
- **Example**:  
    ```ruby
    require 'digest'

    hash = Digest::MD5.hexdigest("Hello, Secure World!")
    puts "MD5 Hash: #{hash}"
    ```

#### 2️⃣ **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)**  
- **Purpose**: Cryptographically secure hashing for passwords.  
- **Example**:  
    ```ruby
    hash = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest("Hello, Secure World!")
    puts "SHA-256 Hash: #{hash}"
    ```

#### 3️⃣ **BCrypt**  
- **Purpose**: Secure password storage with salting.  
- **Example**:  
    ```ruby
    require 'bcrypt'

    password = BCrypt::Password.create("super_secure_password")
    puts "Hashed Password: #{password}"
    ```

## 🔗 Encryption vs Hashing  

| Feature                | **Encryption**                | **Hashing**                  |  
|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|  
| Purpose                | Protect data confidentiality | Verify data integrity       |  
| Reversible?            | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ No                        |  
| Example Use Case       | Sending secure emails        | Storing passwords securely  |
