## 🌟 **Cool Features of PyTorch with Examples**

Let’s explore some of PyTorch’s most exciting features with practical examples:

---

### 1. **Dynamic Computation Graphs** 🔄
Unlike static graphs, PyTorch uses **dynamic computation graphs**, meaning the graph is built on-the-fly as operations are performed. This makes debugging and experimenting a breeze!

```python
import torch

# Define tensors
x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor(3.0, requires_grad=True)

# Perform operations
z = x * y + y ** 2

# Compute gradients
z.backward()

print(x.grad)  # dz/dx = y = 3.0
print(y.grad)  # dz/dy = x + 2y = 2 + 6 = 8.0
```

---

### 2. **Autograd: Automatic Differentiation** 🧮
PyTorch’s `autograd` module automatically computes gradients, which is essential for training neural networks. No more manual gradient calculations! 🎉

```python
# Define a simple linear model
model = torch.nn.Linear(1, 1)

# Loss function and optimizer
criterion = torch.nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    inputs = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0]])
    targets = torch.tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0], [8.0]])

    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)

    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print(model.weight, model.bias)
```

---

### 3. **TorchScript for Production** 🏭
PyTorch’s **TorchScript** allows you to serialize and optimize models for production. This bridges the gap between research and deployment.

```python
# Convert model to TorchScript
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)

# Save the model
scripted_model.save("model.pt")

# Load the model
loaded_model = torch.jit.load("model.pt")
```

---

### 4. **Pre-trained Models with TorchVision** 🖼️
PyTorch’s `torchvision` library provides pre-trained models for computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

```python
import torchvision.models as models

# Load a pre-trained ResNet model
resnet = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Use the model for inference
resnet.eval()
```

---

### 5. **Distributed Training** 🌐
PyTorch makes it easy to scale training across multiple GPUs or machines with its `torch.distributed` module.

```python
import torch.distributed as dist

# Initialize the process group
dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl')

# Use DistributedDataParallel for multi-GPU training
model = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model)
```

---

### 6. **ONNX Support for Interoperability** 🔄
PyTorch supports **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**, allowing you to export models to other frameworks like TensorFlow or Caffe2.

```python
# Export model to ONNX format
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx")
```
