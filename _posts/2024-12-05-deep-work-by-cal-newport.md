## **What Is Deep Work? 🤔**

Newport defines *Deep Work* as:
> "Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit."

These efforts create *high-value* results and improve your skills faster. In contrast, "Shallow Work" refers to tasks that are low-value, repetitive, and often performed amidst distractions.

For example:
- Writing a blog post like this (Deep Work) ✍️
- Checking emails every 5 minutes (Shallow Work) 📩
