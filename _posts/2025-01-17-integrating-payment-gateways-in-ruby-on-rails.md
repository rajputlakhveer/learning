## 💡 Setting Up a Payment Gateway in Rails

Let’s walk through the process of integrating **Stripe** as an example.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Install the Required Gem

Add the Stripe gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'stripe'
```

Run:

```bash
bundle install
```

---

### 🔑 Step 2: Configure Stripe API Keys

Create a new initializer file, `config/initializers/stripe.rb`:

```ruby
Stripe.api_key = ENV['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY']
```

Set your API keys in `.env`:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
```

---

### 📄 Step 3: Create a Payment Form

In your `views/payments/new.html.erb`, add a simple payment form:

```erb
<h1>Make a Payment 💵</h1>

<form action="/payments" method="POST">
  <script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js"
          class="stripe-button"
          data-key="<%= ENV['STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY'] %>"
          data-amount="5000"  <!-- Amount in cents -->
          data-name="My Shop"
          data-description="Payment for your order"
          data-currency="usd">
  </script>
</form>
```

---

### 🔄 Step 4: Handle the Payment Request

Create a PaymentsController to handle payments:

```ruby
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    # Token is generated by Stripe Checkout
    token = params[:stripeToken]

    begin
      charge = Stripe::Charge.create(
        amount: 5000, # Amount in cents
        currency: 'usd',
        source: token,
        description: 'Payment for order #1234'
      )
      flash[:success] = "Payment successful! 🎉"
    rescue Stripe::CardError => e
      flash[:error] = e.message
    end

    redirect_to root_path
  end
end
```

---

## 🔁 Initializing a Refund

Refunds are just as easy to implement:

```ruby
def refund
  begin
    refund = Stripe::Refund.create(
      charge: 'charge_id_here' # Replace with the actual charge ID
    )
    flash[:success] = "Refund processed successfully! 💸"
  rescue Stripe::InvalidRequestError => e
    flash[:error] = e.message
  end

  redirect_to root_path
end
```

## 🏦 Other Payment Gateways

Here’s how to integrate other gateways briefly:

### 🔵 **PayPal**

- Install the `paypal-sdk-rest` gem.
- Use the PayPal REST API for payments and refunds.
- Create a payment URL and redirect the user to complete the payment.

### 🇮🇳 **Razorpay**

- Install the `razorpay` gem.
- Use its APIs for creating orders, capturing payments, and initiating refunds.

### 🔳 **Square**

- Install the `square` gem.
- Use its APIs for creating checkout links and processing refunds.

## 📈 Best Practices for Payment Gateways

1. **Secure your API keys** 🛡️ – Never expose secret keys.
2. **Validate inputs** ✅ – Sanitize and validate all payment-related data.
3. **Handle errors gracefully** 🚨 – Always provide a fallback plan for failed transactions.
4. **Use webhooks** 🔔 – Get real-time updates about payment statuses.
