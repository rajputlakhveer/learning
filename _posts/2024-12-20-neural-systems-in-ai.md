# üß† Neural Systems in AI: Understanding the Brain of Artificial Intelligence üêû

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way we approach technology, and at its heart lies a fascinating concept: Neural Systems. These systems, inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains, form the backbone of machine learning and deep learning. Neural systems vary widely, from simple feedforward networks to sophisticated transformer models, each tailored for specific applications. Let‚Äôs dive into the types of neural systems, their applications, and key concepts with programmable examples. üöÄ

## 1. üåé Artificial Neurons

An artificial neuron mimics the biological neuron, consisting of inputs, weights, a bias, and an activation function. It takes inputs, processes them, and produces an output based on the activation function.

### Application: Basic building block for all neural networks.

### Example in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the inputs and weights
inputs = np.array([1.5, 2.0, -1.0])
weights = np.array([0.4, 0.6, 0.8])
bias = 2.0

# Calculate the output
output = np.dot(inputs, weights) + bias
print(f"Output: {output}")
```

## 2. üîÑ Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)

Feedforward neural networks are the simplest type of artificial neural networks. Information flows in one direction‚Äîfrom input to output‚Äîwith no cycles or loops.

### Applications:
- Image recognition
- Regression tasks

### Example in Python:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Create a simple feedforward neural network
model = Sequential([
    Dense(5, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

# Summarize the model
model.summary()
```

---

## 3. üåê Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.

### Application: Transforming inputs for complex decision-making.

### ReLU Example in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

# Test ReLU function
input_data = np.array([-1, 2, -0.5, 3])
output_data = relu(input_data)
print(f"ReLU Output: {output_data}")
```

---

## 4. üç≠ Backpropagation

Backpropagation adjusts the weights of the network based on the error of the output. It‚Äôs a crucial step in training neural networks.

### Application: Training neural networks for accurate predictions.

### Simplified Backpropagation Example:
```python
def backpropagate(weights, learning_rate, error):
    gradient = error * learning_rate
    updated_weights = weights - gradient
    return updated_weights

# Example values
weights = np.array([0.5, 0.8, 0.3])
error = 0.2
learning_rate = 0.01

new_weights = backpropagate(weights, learning_rate, error)
print(f"Updated Weights: {new_weights}")
```

## 5. üß® Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs specialize in image processing tasks by extracting spatial features through convolutional layers.

### Applications:
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Medical imaging

### Example of a Simple CNN:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.summary()
```

---

## 6. üåç Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are designed for sequence data, where the output of one step serves as input for the next. They‚Äôre widely used in natural language processing.

### Applications:
- Text generation
- Speech recognition
- Time-series prediction

### RNN Example:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense

model = Sequential([
    SimpleRNN(50, activation='tanh', input_shape=(10, 1)),
    Dense(1)
])

model.summary()
```

## 7. üéÆ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs consist of two networks‚Äîa generator and a discriminator‚Äîcompeting against each other. The generator tries to create fake data, while the discriminator works to identify real from fake.

### Applications:
- Image synthesis
- Style transfer
- Data augmentation

### Basic GAN Example:
```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Generator
generator = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=100),
    Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Discriminator
discriminator = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=784),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

generator.summary()
discriminator.summary()
```

## 8. üåÄ Transformer Models

Transformers, such as GPT and BERT, revolutionized AI with their attention mechanisms, enabling better handling of sequential data.

### Applications:
- Machine translation
- Sentiment analysis
- Chatbots

### Transformer Attention Example:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Attention mechanism
query = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10, 64))
key = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10, 64))
value = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10, 64))

attention_output = tf.keras.layers.Attention()([query, key, value])
print(f"Attention Output Shape: {attention_output.shape}")
```
