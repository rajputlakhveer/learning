  const onSubmit = (data) => console.log(data);

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <input {...register('username', { required: true })} placeholder="Username" />
      {errors.username && <span>This field is required ❗</span>}
      
      <input type="submit" value="Sign Up ✅" />
    </form>
  );
};
```
**Why Use It?**  
Because it’s the ultimate library for handling forms with elegance and performance in React. 📝

    rowHeight={50}
    rowCount={items.length}
    rowRenderer={({ index, key, style }) => (
      <div key={key} style={style}>
        {items[index]} 🎈
      </div>
    )}
  />

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <p>You typed: {text} 💬</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```
