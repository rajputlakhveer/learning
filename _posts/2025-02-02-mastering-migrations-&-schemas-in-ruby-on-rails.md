## 🔥 What are Migrations in Rails?

Migrations are like **version control for your database**. They allow you to modify database structures without writing raw SQL. Instead, Rails provides an easy-to-use DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to create, alter, or remove tables, columns, and indexes.

### 📌 Creating a Migration
To generate a migration, run:
```bash
rails generate migration AddAgeToUsers age:integer
```
This creates a file in `db/migrate/` with a structured method:
```ruby
class AddAgeToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :age, :integer
  end
end
```
Apply the migration with:
```bash
rails db:migrate
```

### 🎯 Pro Hacks for Migrations

1. **Rolling Back the Last Migration** 🔄  
   ```bash
   rails db:rollback
   ```
   Want to go back multiple steps? Add `STEP=n`:
   ```bash
   rails db:rollback STEP=2
   ```

2. **Reverting Migrations Without Losing Data** 🔄
   ```ruby
   class AddAgeToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
     def up
       add_column :users, :age, :integer
     end

     def down
       remove_column :users, :age
     end
   end
   ```
   This ensures flexibility when reverting changes.

3. **Renaming a Column the Right Way** 🛠️
   ```ruby
   def change
     rename_column :users, :age, :years_old
   end
   ```
   Pro tip: This preserves data instead of dropping & recreating the column!

4. **Adding Default Values Without Issues** 🏆
   ```ruby
   def change
     add_column :users, :status, :string, default: "active"
   end
   ```

5. **Performing Data Migrations Within Migrations** 📊
   ```ruby
   def up
     User.update_all(status: "active")
   end
   ```
   ⚠️ **Avoid using models inside migrations after deployment, as schema changes may break them!**

## 📜 Schemas in Rails

The **schema** represents the structure of the database and is maintained in `db/schema.rb`. Every time you run migrations, Rails updates this file to reflect the latest database structure.

### 🧐 Understanding `db/schema.rb`
This file contains an auto-generated DSL representing the database tables, columns, and indexes:
```ruby
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 20240201234567) do
  create_table "users", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string "name"
    t.integer "age"
    t.string "status", default: "active"
  end
end
```

### 🔥 Tricks for Managing Schema

1. **Reset the Database & Reload Schema** 🏗️  
   ```bash
   rails db:reset
   ```
   This drops, recreates, and reloads the schema.

2. **Dump the Schema in SQL Format** 📂  
   If you're using raw SQL features like stored procedures, switch from `schema.rb` to `structure.sql`:
   ```ruby
   config.active_record.schema_format = :sql
   ```

3. **Ignoring Certain Tables in Schema Dump** 🛑
   ```ruby
   ActiveRecord::SchemaDumper.ignore_tables = ["sessions", "audit_logs"]
   ```
   This is useful when handling external database tables.

## 🔗 Using Multiple Databases in Rails 🛢️

Rails **6+** introduced built-in support for multiple databases, allowing you to split models across different databases easily!

### 🌟 Configure `database.yml`
```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: 5

production:
  primary:
    <<: *default
    database: my_primary_db
  analytics:
    <<: *default
    database: my_analytics_db
```

### 🛠️ Setting Up Multiple Databases in Models
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  connects_to database: { writing: :primary, reading: :primary }
end

class AnalyticsReport < ApplicationRecord
  connects_to database: { writing: :analytics, reading: :analytics }
end
```

### 🚀 Running Migrations for Different Databases
```bash
rails db:migrate
rails db:migrate:primary
rails db:migrate:analytics
```

This setup helps in **load balancing**, **performance optimization**, and **data separation** in large applications! 🏆
