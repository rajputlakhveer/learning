### 🛠️ Types of Push Notifications in Rails

1. **In-App Notifications 📩**
2. **Web Push Notifications 🌐**
3. **Mobile Push Notifications 📱**
4. **Email as Push Notifications ✉️**
5. **Using Third-Party Services 🛠️**

---

### 1. In-App Notifications 📩

In-app notifications appear within your application. Rails has several ways to implement these, including creating your own notification system or using gems like `Notification` or `Noticed`.

**Setup Example with `Noticed` Gem**

1. **Add the gem:**

   ```ruby
   gem 'noticed'
   ```

2. **Generate a Notification Model:**

   ```bash
   rails generate noticed:model NewMessageNotification
   ```

3. **Define Notification Content:**

   Edit `app/notifications/new_message_notification.rb` to customize the message:

   ```ruby
   class NewMessageNotification < Noticed::Base
     deliver_by :database
     
     def message
       "You have a new message from #{params[:sender_name]}!"
     end
   end
   ```

4. **Trigger Notification:**

   Use the notification within your controller:

   ```ruby
   NewMessageNotification.with(sender_name: @user.name).deliver_later(recipient)
   ```

5. **Display Notification in View:**

   ```erb
   <% current_user.notifications.each do |notification| %>
     <p><%= notification.message %></p>
   <% end %>
   ```

💡 *In-app notifications are perfect for alerting users of updates or activities while they’re actively using the app.*

### 2. Web Push Notifications 🌐

Web push notifications reach users even when they're not actively browsing your app. To implement this in Rails, you can use the `webpush` gem to send messages directly to the browser.

**Setup Example with `webpush` Gem**

1. **Install the gem:**

   ```ruby
   gem 'webpush'
   ```

2. **Generate VAPID Keys:**

   Use VAPID keys to authenticate your server with web browsers.

   ```bash
   require 'webpush'
   vapid_key = Webpush.generate_key
   ```

3. **Store and Use VAPID Keys:**

   Save these keys in your credentials file for security.

4. **Send Push Notification:**

   ```ruby
   Webpush.payload_send(
     message: "Hello from Rails!",
     endpoint: subscription[:endpoint],
     p256dh: subscription[:keys][:p256dh],
     auth: subscription[:keys][:auth],
     vapid: {
       subject: "mailto:you@example.com",
       public_key: ENV['VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY'],
       private_key: ENV['VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY']
     }
   )
   ```

🌐 *Web push notifications are great for re-engaging users after they've left your app.*

---

### 3. Mobile Push Notifications 📱

For mobile apps, push notifications can be sent to iOS and Android devices using services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for iOS.

**Setup Example with FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)**

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**

   Register your app in Firebase Console and get the FCM server key.

2. **Send Notification Using `fcm` Gem:**

   ```ruby
   gem 'fcm'
   ```

3. **Initialize and Send Notification:**

   ```ruby
   fcm = FCM.new("YOUR_SERVER_KEY")
   registration_ids = ["device_token_1", "device_token_2"]

   options = { notification: { title: "Hello!", body: "New message received." } }
   response = fcm.send(registration_ids, options)
   ```

📱 *Mobile push notifications keep users engaged on the go!*

### 4. Email as Push Notifications ✉️

Emails work as an indirect push notification method. For Rails, Action Mailer provides an easy way to send emails with minimal setup.

**Setup Example Using Action Mailer**

1. **Generate Mailer:**

   ```bash
   rails generate mailer NotificationMailer
   ```

2. **Define Mailer Content:**

   ```ruby
   class NotificationMailer < ApplicationMailer
     def new_message_email(user)
       @user = user
       mail(to: @user.email, subject: "You have a new message!")
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Trigger Email Notification:**

   ```ruby
   NotificationMailer.new_message_email(@user).deliver_later
   ```

📧 *Email notifications are ideal for transactional updates like password resets or order confirmations.*

### 5. Using Third-Party Services 🛠️

For more advanced needs, third-party push notification services like **OneSignal** or **Pusher** provide robust features for managing notifications, targeting specific audiences, and gaining insights.

**Setup Example with OneSignal**

1. **Register for OneSignal:**

   Sign up on [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) and create a new application.

2. **Install the OneSignal SDK:**

   Use the provided instructions to set up OneSignal with your Rails app.

3. **Send Notification:**

   Once integrated, you can send notifications via their API:

   ```ruby
   require 'net/http'
   uri = URI("https://onesignal.com/api/v1/notifications")

   response = Net::HTTP.post(
     uri,
     {
       app_id: "YOUR_APP_ID",
       headings: { en: "New Update!" },
       contents: { en: "Check out the latest features!" },
       included_segments: ["Subscribed Users"]
     }.to_json,
     "Content-Type" => "application/json",
     "Authorization" => "Basic YOUR_REST_API_KEY"
   )
   ```

💥 *Third-party services are perfect for larger apps requiring in-depth analytics and segmented messaging.*
