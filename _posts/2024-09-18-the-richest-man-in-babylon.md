#### 1. **Start Thy Purse to Fattening (Pay Yourself First) 💸**

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93e60335-baad-4cf4-997b-0351b46e50db)

**The Idea:**
Save at least 10% of your earnings before spending on anything else. You must prioritize paying yourself first.

**Quote:**
*"A part of all you earn is yours to keep."* – George S. Clason

**Example:**
If you earn ₹50,000 a month, set aside ₹5,000 (10%) before touching the rest. Over a year, this turns into ₹60,000! 🎯 This could go into an investment that grows over time, giving you a cushion for your future.

#### 2. **Control Thy Expenditures (Live Below Your Means) 🛑**

**The Idea:**
Don’t confuse desires with necessities. Learn to manage your expenses and spend less than you earn.

**Quote:**
*"That what each of us calls our 'necessary expenses' will always grow to equal our incomes unless we protest to the contrary."*

**Example:**
You earn ₹1,00,000, but ₹80,000 goes toward unnecessary shopping and luxury dining. 💳💔 By cutting back just ₹20,000 each month, you could save ₹2,40,000 annually. This can either go towards investments or clearing debts.

#### 3. **Make Thy Gold Multiply (Invest Wisely) 📈**

**The Idea:**
Idle money doesn’t grow. Invest in ventures that offer steady returns so your wealth multiplies over time.

**Quote:**
*"The gold you save must be wisely invested, and it will grow like a tree in the forest."*

**Example:**
You have ₹1,00,000 in savings. Rather than keeping it in a bank, you invest in a stock index fund offering an 8% return. In 10 years, that ₹1,00,000 could grow to nearly ₹2,16,000! 🌳✨

**The Idea:**
Be cautious with your investments. Don’t chase after schemes that seem too good to be true.

**Quote:**
*"Guard thy treasures from loss by investing only where thy principal is safe."*

**Example:**
You’re tempted to invest ₹50,000 in a friend’s “get-rich-quick” crypto scheme. ⚠️ Instead, you choose to put that money in a low-risk government bond with guaranteed returns. Avoiding a risky venture has saved you from potential loss. ✅

#### 5. **Make of Thy Dwelling a Profitable Investment (Own Your Home) 🏡**

**The Idea:**
Owning your own home provides long-term security and builds wealth over time. (But as you read Rich Dad Poor Dad not just home but any long-term security includes gold, real estate, rental income, etc.)

**Quote:**
*"Own thy own home, then shalt thou have shelter and security for the future."*

**Example:**
Instead of paying ₹30,000 in rent, you take out a mortgage for a home with a ₹35,000 monthly payment. 🏠 Over the years, your home appreciates in value, creating equity and making it a valuable asset rather than wasted rent money.

**The Idea:**
Save today to ensure you’re secure in the future when you can no longer work.

**Quote:**
*"Provide in advance for the needs of thy growing age and the protection of thy family."*

**Example:**
At 30 years old, you start investing ₹5,000 every month in a retirement plan. By 60, with compounding returns of 8%, you could retire with over ₹1.2 crore, ensuring a comfortable life post-retirement. 🏖️🛌
