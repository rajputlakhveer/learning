## 1. Jenkins 🎛️

**Overview:**  
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that powers your CI/CD pipelines. It integrates with hundreds of plugins and lets you automate everything from building to deploying your code.

**Example Usage:**  
Set up a simple pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys your application.

**Steps:**
1. **Install Jenkins:**  
   Use your package manager or run it via Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts
   ```
2. **Configure Plugins:**  
   Access Jenkins via your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`) and install essential plugins (e.g., Git, Pipeline).
3. **Create a Pipeline Job:**  
   Define a `Jenkinsfile` in your repository:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Build') {
               steps { sh 'make build' }
           }
           stage('Test') {
               steps { sh 'make test' }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
               steps { sh 'make deploy' }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
4. **Run and Monitor:**  
   Commit your changes and let Jenkins run your pipeline. Monitor progress via the dashboard.

## 2. Docker 🐳

**Overview:**  
Docker packages your application and its dependencies into containers, ensuring it runs consistently across all environments.

**Example Usage:**  
Create a Docker image for your Node.js app and run it as a container.

**Steps:**
1. **Write a Dockerfile:**  
   Create a file named `Dockerfile`:
   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:14
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package.json .
   RUN npm install
   COPY . .
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```
2. **Build the Image:**  
   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp .
   ```
3. **Run the Container:**  
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 myapp
   ```
4. **Push to Registry (Optional):**  
   Tag and push your image to Docker Hub or another registry.

## 3. Kubernetes 📦

**Overview:**  
Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications, handling scaling, load balancing, and self-healing seamlessly.

**Example Usage:**  
Deploy your Dockerized application using Kubernetes deployments and services.

**Steps:**
1. **Create a Deployment YAML:**  
   Save the following as `deployment.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp-container
           image: myregistry/myapp:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 3000
   ```
2. **Apply the Deployment:**  
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```
3. **Expose via a Service:**  
   Create a service to expose your deployment:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: myapp-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     selector:
       app: myapp
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 3000
   ```
4. **Monitor:**  
   Use `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment` to check status.

## 4. GitLab CI/CD 🔄

**Overview:**  
GitLab CI/CD is built into GitLab, allowing you to define and run pipelines directly from your repository.

**Example Usage:**  
Automate testing and deployment using a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

**Steps:**
1. **Create .gitlab-ci.yml:**  
   Add the following to your repository:
   ```yaml
   stages:
     - build
     - test
     - deploy

   build_job:
     stage: build
     script:
       - npm install
       - npm run build
     artifacts:
       paths:
         - dist/

   test_job:
     stage: test
     script: npm test

   deploy_job:
     stage: deploy
     script: npm run deploy
   ```
2. **Commit and Push:**  
   GitLab automatically triggers your pipeline.
3. **Monitor Pipeline:**  
   Use the GitLab UI to review logs and status.
